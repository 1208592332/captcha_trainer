# TrainsPath and TestPath: The local absolute path of your training and testing set.
# TestSetNum: This is an optional parameter that is used when you want to extract some of the test set
# - from the training set when you are not preparing the test set separately.

# ValidationSteps: Used to calculate accuracy, Default value is 100.
# TestNum: The number of samples for each test batch.
# - A test for every saved steps.
# EndAcc: Finish the training when the accuracy reaches [EndAcc*100]%.
# EndEpochs: Finish the training when the epoch is greater than the defined epoch.
