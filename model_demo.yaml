# FieldParam contains the Image, Text.
# When you filed to Image:
# - Category: Provides a default optional built-in solution:
# -- [ALPHANUMERIC, ALPHANUMERIC_LOWER, ALPHANUMERIC_UPPER,
# -- NUMERIC, ALPHABET_LOWER, ALPHABET_UPPER, ALPHABET, ALPHANUMERIC_LOWER_MIX_CHINESE_3500]

# TrainsPath and TestPath: The local absolute path of your training and testing set.
# DatasetPath: Package a sample of the TFRecords format from this path.
# ValidationSetNum: This is an optional parameter that is used when you want to extract some of the test set
# - from the training set when you are not preparing the test set separately.
# SavedSteps: A Session.run() execution is called a Step,
# - Used to save training progress, Default value is 100.
# ValidationSteps: Used to calculate accuracy, Default value is 500.
# TestSetNum: The number of test sets, if an automatic allocation strategy is used (TestPath not set).
# EndAcc: Finish the training when the accuracy reaches [EndAcc*100]% and other conditions.
# EndCost: Finish the training when the cost reaches EndCost and other conditions.
# EndEpochs: Finish the training when the epoch is greater than the defined epoch and other conditions.
# BatchSize: Number of samples selected for one training step.
# VerificationBatchSize: Number of samples selected for one validation step.
